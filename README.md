# Overview

I wanted to learn the basics of Kotlin. I downloaded Java, Kotlin, a compiler for Kotlin and some
Kolin extensions in Visual Studio Code. Initially, I was feeling intimidated at the prospect of 
learning Kotlin, so I stuck with a familiar IDE. However, in hind sight, working in IntelliJ 
would have actually made things easier.

I ended up writing many files as I learned and experimented with the syntax of Kotlin.

The first program I wrote was first.kt. It is a simple hello world program that confirmed I downloaded
everything correctly and got my environment working to start coding in Kotlin.

The main program in this repository is avatar.kt.
It is a quiz to tell the user what kind of elemental bender they would be in the world of avatar.
This is where I spent most of my effort and learned most of the common syntax uses for Kotlin.

The shapes.kt file is where I learned to implement classes and loops in Kotlin.
It is a program that prints a square and a triangle to the screen using keyboard characters.

The other files (demo.kt, other.kt, and practice.kt) were files I used to test concepts without
potentially messing up my larger programs like avatar.kt.
demo.kt was my first attempt at classes.
other.kt is how I what the main function did and more about variable types.
practice.kt is how I learned to get input from the user and conditional statements.

I now know the basics of Kotlin, though my code is not perfect and there's still more I could learn.
I'm proud of the progress I made in about 17 hours of work spaced out over 2 weeks.


This video only demonstrates avatar.kt and shapes.kt.

# Development Environment

* Language: Kotlin
* IDE: Visual Studio Code
* Control Manager: GitHub


# Useful Websites

* [w3schools/kotlin](https://www.w3schools.com/kotlin/)
* [Kotlin Documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/)
* [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn)


# Future Work

All of this is for main avatar program:
* No way to handle 3-way tie
* Tie is triggered if anything ties, not just high score
* Not sure why I get a warning that 'water' assigned to 'var highScore' is never used
* No error handling for potential capital letter input
* Code could probably be efficient with some revision
